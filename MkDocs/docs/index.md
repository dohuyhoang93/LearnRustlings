# Welcome to LearnRustlings Documentation\!

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide and personal knowledge base for my journey through the [Rustlings exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). Here, you'll find my solutions, explanations, and key takeaways for each exercise, organized for easy navigation and reference.

-----

## What is Rustlings?

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) is a fantastic command-line tool designed to help you learn the Rust programming language by solving small, bite-sized exercises. Each exercise focuses on a specific Rust concept, gradually building your understanding from the basics to more advanced topics. It's an interactive and hands-on way to solidify your Rust knowledge.

-----

## Why This Documentation?

As I progress through Rustlings, I've created this documentation for several reasons:

  * **Personal Learning:** To reinforce my understanding of Rust concepts by articulating solutions and explanations in my own words.
  * **Knowledge Base:** To build a searchable and organized repository of solutions and common Rust patterns.
  * **Future Reference:** To quickly recall how specific Rust features work or how certain problems were solved.
  * **Sharing:** To potentially help other learners by providing alternative perspectives or detailed breakdowns of the exercises.

## Repository Structure

This MkDocs documentation is built from the content within the `https://github.com/dohuyhoang93/LearnRustlings` repository. The exercise solutions and explanations are structured to mirror the Rustlings exercise categories for logical flow.

You can navigate through the exercises using the sidebar. Each section corresponds to a Rustlings module (e.g., `variables`, `functions`, `collections`, `smart_pointers`, etc.).

-----

## Getting Started

To explore the exercises and their explanations:

1.  **Navigate the Sidebar:** Use the navigation menu on the left to browse through different Rustlings categories and individual exercises.
2.  **Search:** Use the search bar to quickly find specific topics or exercise names.
