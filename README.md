# ðŸ¦€ LearnRustlings: My Rust Story ðŸš€

-----

This repo is my personal workspace for learning Rust with [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). I'm using it to track my progress and write down what I learn.

For me, just finishing an exercise isn't enough. I need to write notes about *why* things work (or don't). This helps me really understand Rust's concepts. Think of this repo as my own study guide, built one step at a time.

### What I'm Documenting Here

I keep the original Rustlings exercise files in this repo as they are. My notes and explanations are in a separate place:

  * **My Notes (`MkDocs/docs/Documents/`):** This folder holds all my detailed notes for each Rustlings exercise. Each note comes with **explanations to clarify the concepts**. I also try to **describe these concepts more abstractly** to help build a deeper understanding. Finally, I **summarize the core points** for quick review. This `Documents` folder is also the source for **this repo's website**.

You can see all these notes clearly on my website here: **[GitHub Pages site](https://dohuyhoang93.github.io/LearnRustlings/)**.

Learning Rust is a real process. Every time an exercise compiles, it's a small win. My goal is to get a solid grasp of Rust, one line of code at a time.
